# Harry Sir introduced us to some amazing programs like Jarvis (Virtual Assistant), Love Calculator, Face Detection, Flappy Bird, and Snake Game.

# Learned how each program works and understood the logic behind games and AI-based tools.

# Downloaded all programs from Harry Sirâ€™s Replit link.

# Ran the programs locally on my computer using VS Code.

# Learned how to import and use Python modules while running programs locally.

# Enjoyed experimenting with every project â€” it was a fun and exciting learning experience ðŸ˜„.
