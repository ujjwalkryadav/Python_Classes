#                     [ 0,  1, 2, 3, 4,]
                 #    [ -5,-4,-3,-2,-1 ]       
#so -4 place is place of a and - 2 is placce of r so output is ar.




'''
Learned that the len() function is used to count the total number of characters in a word or sentence.
Understood that each letter in a string has an index number, starting from 0 on the left and negative numbers (-1, -2, …) from the right.
Learned about string slicing — [start:end] includes the start index but excludes the end index.
Discovered how to print specific parts or letters from a word using index numbers and slicing. '''
