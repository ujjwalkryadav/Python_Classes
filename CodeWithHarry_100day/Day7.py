#Summary Of Day 7
# Exercise 1 - Create a Calculator
# Create a calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations on two numbers. Your program should format the output in a readable manner!
'''
The task was to create a simple calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division â€” but I went a step further! âœ¨
I added extra features like floor division, modulus, and exponentiation to explore more and enhance my learning. ðŸ’ª
