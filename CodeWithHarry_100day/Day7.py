a = 5
b = 10
print("First Number is = 5")
print("second Number is = 10\n")

print("Addition Of 5 and 10 =", a + b)
print("Subtraction Of  5 and 10=", a - b)
print("Multiplication Of 5 and 10=", a * b)
print("Division Of 5 and 10=", a / b)
print("floor division Of 5 and 10=", a // b)
print("modulus Of 5 and 10=", a % b)
print("exponentiation Of 5 and 10=", a ** b)
