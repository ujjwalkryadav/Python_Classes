# üóìÔ∏è DAY 11 NOTES
# Topic: String, Quotation Marks, Concatenation, and Replication


# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Printing Strings with Different Quotation Marks
print("this is Ravi")
print('this is Ravi')
print('''This is Ravi''')
#program END ---------------


# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Quotation Marks
# ' '   => Single Quotation mark
# " "   => Double Quotation mark
# ''' ''' => Triple Quotation mark

first_sentence = "Rohan's watch"   # using double quotes outside
second_sentence = 'Rohan'          # using single quotes
third_sentence = '''It was the fantastic topic "Hostel life"'''
print(first_sentence)
print(second_sentence)
print(third_sentence)
#program END ---------------


# 3Ô∏è‚É£ String Basics
# Integer  -> 3, 4, 5, 6
# Float    -> 3.3, 5.9
# String   -> "Ravi", "Python", "Java"
# Boolean  -> True, False
# Character -> 'H'

# String = sequence of characters
# Example: "Pandey", "Niraj", "Ajit", "This is Ravi"
#program END ---------------


# 4Ô∏è‚É£ String Concatenation (+)
first_name = "Sonu"
last_name = "xyz"
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
print(full_name)
# Output: Sonu xyz
#program END ---------------


# 5Ô∏è‚É£ String Replication (*)
first_name = "Sonu"
last_name = "xyz"
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name

print(first_name)
print(full_name)
print(full_name * 6)  # repeats the string 6 times

name = "Ravi"
print(name * 70)      # repeats 'Ravi' 70 times
#program END ---------------

üßæ DAY 11 SUMMARY

‚úÖ Today we learned:
- How to use different types of quotation marks:
  ' ' (single), " " (double), ''' ''' (triple).
- String is a sequence of characters.
- String Concatenation (+): joins two strings together.
- String Replication (*): repeats the same string multiple times.

üí° Main Concept:
In coding, words or sentences are represented as **strings**.
Using quotes properly helps in handling text data without syntax errors.
