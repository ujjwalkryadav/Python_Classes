# 1. Mutable and Immutable
# Mutable OR Changeable: => it can be changed entirely as well as specifically.
# Example: List, Dictionary, Set

# Immutable OR Unchangeable: => it can be changed entirely but not specifically.
# Example: Tuple, String, Frozen Set


# -> Mutable and Immutable Example Explain
# Mutable example: List

#        0   1   2   3   4
listt = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55]
print("before changes :", listt)

listt[2] = 777
print("after changes  :", listt)





# listt is a mutable object.
# The element at index 2 is changed from 33 to 777 without creating a new list.

# Immutable example: String
my_name = "Aditya"
print("before changes :", my_name)

print(my_name[0])  # A

#  0 1 2 3 4 5
#  A d i t y a







my_name = "Wilmot"
print("before changes :", my_name)
my_name = "Wilmot"
print("After Changes", my_name[0])  # W


# Strings are immutable, so this kind of change is not allowed:
# python
# my_name[0] = "Z"  # Error: Strings are immutable
# print("after changes  :", my_name)


# But reassigning the whole variable is allowed (new string object is created):
# python
name = "Suhani"
print("before changes :", name)

name = "Nisha"   # Entire value reassigned (allowed)
print("after changes  :", name)




# Tuple: basic concept
# A tuple is a collection which is immutable and ordered.
# It cannot be changed after creation.
# python
my_tuple = (122, 222, 322, 42, 52)
print(my_tuple)





# Tuple length

my_tuple = (111, 111, 111, 22, 7879)
print(len(my_tuple))   ##




len(my_tuple) #gives the number of elements in the tuple.

# Types of brackets
# ( ) => Parenthesis
# [ ] => Square brackets
# { } => Curly braces

# Tuple indexing
# python
# #          0     1    2    3   4
my_tuple = (122, 222, 322, 42, 52)
print(my_tuple)

print(my_tuple[0])
print(my_tuple[4])






# Index 0 gives the first element.
# Index 4 gives the last element.




# Loop through a tuple
my_tuple = (122, 222, 322, 42, 52)
print(my_tuple)

for i in my_tuple:
    print(i)





# The for loop prints each element of the tuple one by one.

# Tuple methods
# count() – returns the number of occurrences of any element
# python
my_tuple = (111, 111, 111, 22, 7879)
print(my_tuple.count(111))   ## 3






# index() – returns the index of first occurrence

my_tuple = (111, 111, 111, 22, 7879)
print(my_tuple.index(111))   ## 0




# len() – returns number of elements

my_tuple = (111, 111, 111, 22, 7879)
print(len(my_tuple)) #5       




# Negative indexing in tuple
# python
#           -5   -4   -3   -2  -1
my_tuple = (122, 222, 322, 42, 52)
print(my_tuple[-2])   ## 42
